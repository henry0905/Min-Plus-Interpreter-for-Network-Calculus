UAF (Ultimately affine function)
This program aims to interpret the Ultimately affine function in Network Calculus to the Graphic latex function. 
uaf(SEGMENT+) includes many segments which are defined from point to point, with last segment having slope and right point.

For example, f6:=uaf([(0,0)0(1,0)] ](1,2)0(2,2)] ](2,3)1(+Infinity,+Infinity)[)
There are 3 segments in this function:
- The first one shows [(0,0)0(1,0)] from point (0,0) to point (1,0) with the slope is 0 and we also take the point (0,0) and (1,0) in the line.
- The second one shows ](1,2)0(2,2)] from point (1,2) to point (2,2) with the slope is 0 and we only take the point (2,2) in the line.
- The thrid one shows ](2,3)1(+Infinity,+Infinity)[ from point (2,3) to point (+Infinity,+Infinity) with the slope 1 and we do not take the border points.

This is a part of my internship so I only show one function.
